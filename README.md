# r Drunk Wordcloud

This is a simple program that generates a wordcloud from the Wikipedia article of `Drunk` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk).

When running `./wordfun.r` you will see a wordcloud generated in `Rplots.pdf`.

You need the R packages specified in shell.nix so that'd be wordcloud, stopwords, tm, slam.

Have fun1
